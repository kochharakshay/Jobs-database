An Opportunity to Pioneer Innovation in Chronic Care Management
If you’ve ever wished you had a job that could make a difference in someone’s life, this is your chance to support a new approach to chronic care management. Welldoc is pushing the industry forward – helping health plans, health systems and employers move beyond traditional health coaching and consumer mobile apps. As a pioneer in digital therapeutics, we’re helping to simplify people’s healthcare experience, drive improved self-care and support consumer empowerment.
Welldoc has two randomized clinical trials and 40+ peer-reviewed studies that clearly demonstrate the clinical impact of our solution. Welldoc was the first to receive FDA clearance for a diabetes software solution (Class II Medical Device) and continues to drive market innovation across conditions. In an extremely crowded space, we offer differentiated approaches while ensuring value for our clients through performance-based payments.

If you are passionate about driving the health care industry forward to better improve the lives of patients, members and employees, let’s talk!

Working closely with our sales, marketing, client success, product and engineering teams, you’ll dive into a powerful data set to help us structure analysis and develop insights that will help to answer important questions that affect millions of patients in today’s health care system. Digital therapeutics and BlueStar allow, for the first time, extension of the data available in most healthcare systems today by adding both patient-reported data as well as high-frequency data, neither of which are collected today because the daily, patient-facing collection mechanisms simply do not exist. This enhanced-scale data collection and analysis becomes the basis of data-driven design for our product, and data-driven delivery for our customers. The complexity, challenge, opportunity and most importantly, impact of your insights would be difficult to match elsewhere. Your role will be to conduct different kinds of analysis- informative, correlative or discovery, extrapolative or predictive and adaptive, to address the questions that could be asked of a patient’s healthcare data. You will do this by working with data tools and structuring efficient queries to build models that answer those questions, providing feedback to data engineers, product managers as well as external stakeholders. Your analysis will be the fulcrum of a new generation of value delivery that is driven by data, information, knowledge and action that can be interpreted and consumed by the patients and providers who need you. The responsibilited for this role will include but not be limited to the following:
As part of a project team, contribute to solving business problems by framing the problems, determining intended approach and statistical/quantitative methods, evaluating the analytical solutions to the problems, and deploying them to production
Evaluate and deploy data analysis techniques in four key domains: 1) informative and reporting, including visualization; 2) discovery, including correlative and pattern recognition modeling techniques; 3) extrapolative, including predictive modeling techniques, and 4) adaptive, including machine learning, natural language processing and adaptive modeling techniques
Build scalable and high-performance engines that automate the above four classes of analysis where possible
Rapidly test hypotheses by developing prototypes, running off-line experiments, and on-line statistical models and tests
Generate actionable insights by applying analytical rigor to multiple types of data including metabolic data, medication data, lifestyle data, symptom data, socio-economic and social determinant data, and in the future, genomic data
Generate various reports and visualizations to provide insight into the workings of products in different customer and operating environments
Document projects including business objective, data gathering and processing, leading approaches, final algorithm, detailed set of results and analytical metrics. Develops materials to explain project findings. Explain findings to internal and external business audiences

Centric Consulting is not the typical consulting company. We live our core values and bring them with us in all we do for our clients and community. Our core purpose is simple: every day we strive to provide unmatched customer and employee experiences and foster a culture of respect, diversity, and transparency. It’s this culture, our people, and delivery that come together to make Centric a trusted advisor to local businesses.

Our Boston business unit is a draw for Fortune 500 companies, long time family-run companies, and start-ups alike. Our clients know that we are honest, transparent and deliver on our commitments. We have built our team with people who embrace the freedom and responsibility our model depends upon. We’re looking for a Business Analyst to join our growing team.

In this role, you will:
Work with business stakeholders to gather and document business needs and translate them into operational requirements.
Ability to translate business vision into defined and prioritized stories for the team backlog.
Expertise in various business analysis methodologies, including data analysis, use case development, story writing, and user acceptance testing and product documentation.

Consulting experience is strongly preferred. That said, you will also be considered if you have a strong industry background. We like to work in the communities we live in.
We want someone who likes to solve problems. Clients don’t come to us when the problem is easy. You should enjoy taking on the hard stuff.
And because we work with clients, excellent communication skills are important – both written and verbal. Translating technical concepts into layman’s terms is an essential skill.
Initiative is important. We don’t hand hold – you should be comfortable working independently in an entrepreneurial environment. That said, collaboration is equally important. Our Boston team and other [technologists or consultants] at Centric will give you an amazing support system. You will lean on them daily.
Last, but not least, you will need to be an experienced Business Analyst. We are looking for people with a proven track record and with at least 5+ years of experience working as a Business Analyst in a consulting environment. You must have experience with examining business systems and processes to identify user needs, document requirements, epics, and stories, and address operational issues.
What makes Centric different?
Special Culture – Our people make us different. We have highly talented, intelligent individuals across a broad variety of disciplines – who are eager to learn from you and share their own expertise. We embrace fresh perspectives and each other. Don’t take our word for it – check us out on Glassdoor, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to get a glimpse inside what makes us different.
Growth opportunities – As a mid-size firm, there is more flexibility when it comes to career paths. Figure out what you want to do and we'll help you figure out how to get there.
Impact – We think of ourselves as a big company with a small company feel – a local player with global reach that combines business, technology and industry expertise.
Unmatched Experiences – We are allowed to be ourselves here. We are encouraged to be human. It’s at the root of who we are as a firm and why we’re here.
Innovation – We value passion, determination, perseverance, and innovation. We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going.
Passion for the greater good – We are steadfast in our devotion to the communities we serve and in actively promoting employee involvement in community improvement projects.
Centric believes the best solutions come from diverse teams.
