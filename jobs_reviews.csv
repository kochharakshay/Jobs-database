Creativity is welcomed, as is a take-charge mentality that many companies shy away from in their staff. The benefits are great, the flying perks are outstanding, and the culture is work-life balance focused. AOPA isn't perfect, but it's a breath of fresh air compared to companies that focus on leaning expenses, putting employee satisfaction on the bottom of the priority list.

The difference can be seen with the initiatives and changes that have gained momentum under his leadership.","As with any company, there are people at AOPA who do not want to change, who see new people as a threat, and who get complacent in their high-ranking titles, earned by tenure. No doubt negative reviews hang on frustrations caused by those people, justifiably. But that being said, the challenging few are overshadowed by genuinely good people with great ideas. Under Baker's leadership, the organization is making some real headway and heading in the right direction.

RE232,"""Accounting Departement""","The finance/accounting department is a great team. Quirky bunch to say the least, but solid leadership and everyones in good spirits all the time. And obviously as an accountant that's who you spend 95% of the time with. But there are good opportunities to work cross functional with other departments and the whole company is definitely connected. The gym/kitchen are awesome, and really build a sense of community for the company as a whole. You can tell people who don't necessarily work together are still friends just from mingling and stuff in the office, its nice to see. Leadership of the other departments are all friendly, and the CEO is a baller. Monthly town hall meetings and other guest speaker events are a nice touch too. Overall company culture is great here and the open floor plan in the Dev Center is definitely part of the reason why","For the accounting department specifically - Just moved to another office across the parking lot, which doesn't have the same feel as the main office. More of a corporate office feel and although the stand up desks are a nice touch, it still feels pretty congested in there. I know that the plan is to move to another large office for everyone eventually, but for now thats kinda a bummer. And for the company as a whole, it seems like there might be some sort of disconnect between departments (just analyzing from a financial side), and maybe some departments feel like others are stepping on their toes. As the retail business is growing, its guaranteed to take away from the other areas of the biz so thats something that needs to be figured out -- but aside from this stuff there aren't many cons.",25-Oct-17,Former Employee , Anonymous,R0247

RE234,"""Great company!""","Having experience working for both large and small management consulting firms in the DC area, BRMi’s leadership team, commitment to delivery excellence, investment in employees, and culture is second to none. BRMi’s leadership team is engaging, thoughtful, and open-minded. Have a great new idea, concept, or improvement idea? Bring it directly to the top and make your pitch. New ideas aren’t only considered, they’re encouraged. Commitment to delivery excellence doesn’t stop with employees on the client site. The management team ensures BRMi is delivering the right solution the right way, and not the wrong solution the fast way by engaging directly with clients to understand the heart of their problems. You can’t get that level of engagement or intimacy from a larger firm. BRMi takes a vested interest in growing and maturing employees’ careers through a multitude of resources. Want to earn your PMP, become a Scrum Master, or go to training for that new tool or certification to further your career? Submit a request through BRMi’s Training Center. Don’t have time for a full training class, but want to learn more? BRMi has recurring Brown Bag Series and has developed Career Paths that allow employees to continue knowledge growth at a self-paced level. BRMi also hosts leadership training for rising employees and sponsors employees for entry into industry-government organizations. I’ve never seen a company provide more opportunities or options to further an employee’s career. BRMi hosts multiple events throughout the year including a holiday party, family picnic, Nats games, Wizards game, happy hours, and volunteering events to name a few. With employees spread across the DMV, management makes a concerted effort to rotate venues between Virginia, DC, and Maryland to make it easier for employees to attend events. Mike often speaks about the “BRMi Family” and I couldn’t think of a better way to describe it. Events at BRMi are about more than just employees as you’ll quickly get to know spouses, children, and friends. I’ve never worked with a more dedicated, passionate, or driven group of people and wish BRMi nothing but continued success.","As with any firm in the DC area, delivery teams tend to work on the client site which leads to geographically dispersed teams.
